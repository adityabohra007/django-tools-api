difference btw -> start time and first pause instance 

then calcualte pauses total time 
pause 1 = 5mins
pause 2 = 3mins 
..

example 
start time is - 2:21
first pause is - 2:25
4 mins complete 
now pause start to pause complete 
pause end - 2:27 so that 2mins pause
now depending on this 2mins pause and total timer completed find new end_time
so that 
since 4 mins completed , now since 2 mins pause was there so just add 2mins more to end_time to compentitate for pause

but now if before session ends one more pause is added
such that 5mins pause is added 
than again update the end_time by 5mins
